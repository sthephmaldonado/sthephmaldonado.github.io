### For my creative project, I wanted to create an engaging philosophical text using 
### *  [“The Little Prince”]
### *  [“The Prophet” by Khalil Gibran.]
### The text may turn as a text that helps see life in a different way, combining that touch "the little prince" has that is more oriented to kids but, that also has a social criticism directed at the "strangeness" with which adults see things. "The prophet" provides almost 26 themes of different aspects of our lives (love, work, religion, and more)" that may add that spice that we people need to hear in each aspects of our lives.
